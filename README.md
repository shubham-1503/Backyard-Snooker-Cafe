## Overview ðŸŒŸ

One of my friends had opened a cafÃ© and wanted a Point of sale Billing software for it. I happily agreed to provide him with the software which was completely custom-made and looked after almost all his business requirements. The application is currently in use at the cafÃ© and is working flawlessly.

## Technical DetailsðŸš€
- Developed a customized billing software for the cafÃ©, featuring separate admin and user profiles.
- Included features for admin to manage user logins, menu items, analyse sales and individual item trends within a set period.
- Created an easy-to-use billing system for staff, allowing item addition, bill calculation, and printing.
- Finally installed the software on Client desktop and gave training to the staff which has resulted in streamlining transactions, enhancing user service, and facilitating efficient operations.
